								receive when you register for and use our telecommunication services (our "Services"). This Policy 
								explains the practices that apply to your personal information. </p>
			
					<h3>Collection of Your Personal Information</h3>
					  <p> In order to provide our Services, TringMe must collect your personal phone number so we can identify you when you interact

							interest. For more information see the "Changes in Our Privacy Policy" section below. </p>

							provided on or through other websites operated by or in conjunction with third party providers 
							("Partners"). Although TringMe will continue to control any personally identifiable information collected
							about you from one of these sites, such information may be shared by TringMe with that Partner in 
							order to further facilitate the Services to which you register. However, a Partner will not rent, sell, or 
							disclose any of your personally identifiable information to third parties unless you consent to such 
							disclosures and use in advance (for example, you may be asked to opt-in on a particular co-branded site 
							in order to receive information or offers from a Partner, its affiliates or agents). </p>
